# Deeper iOS App

This is the SwiftUI iOS version of the Deeper voice training app, migrated from the original Expo/React Native implementation.

## Project Overview

**Deeper** is a voice training application that guides users through a comprehensive onboarding process to create a personalized voice improvement plan. The app uses a dark theme with orange accent colors and features an anime-inspired aesthetic.

## Migration from Expo App

This iOS app replicates the structure and functionality of the original Expo app located in `../deeper/`. Key elements migrated include:

### Design System
- **Colors**: Matching color palette from the Expo theme
  - Background: `#0D0A12`
  - Card: `#15121C`
  - Text Primary: `#FFFFFF`
  - Text Secondary: `#C9C6D0`
  - Accent: `#FF6A00`
  - Success: `#22C55E`
  - Warning: `#F59E0B`
  - Danger: `#EF4444`

- **Typography**: Font sizes and spacing matching the original design
- **Components**: SwiftUI equivalents of React Native components
  - `PrimaryButton` â†’ Expo `PrimaryButton`
  - `ProgressBar` â†’ Expo `ProgressBar`
  - `GradientScreen` â†’ Expo `GradientScreen`

### Onboarding Flow
The app implements the same 15-step onboarding process as the original:

1. **Welcome** - Introduction with character art placeholder
2. **ArtStyle** - Artistic style selection
3. **NamePhoto** - User profile setup
4. **VoiceTrainHours** - Voice training frequency
5. **BreathworkMinutes** - Breathwork duration
6. **ReadAloudPages** - Reading aloud practice
7. **LoudEnvironmentsHours** - Time in loud environments
8. **SteamHumidifyFrequency** - Vocal care practices
9. **ExtrasChooser** - Additional features (max 2 selections)
10. **DownGlidesCount** - Vocal exercise frequency
11. **TechniqueStudyDaily** - Daily technique practice
12. **Permissions** - App permissions
13. **Aims** - User goals and preferences
14. **Analyzing** - Processing responses
15. **CurrentRating** - Current voice assessment
16. **PotentialRating** - Potential voice improvement

### Data Models
- `OnboardingAnswers` - Structured data model for user responses
- `OnboardingStore` - State management using SwiftUI's `@StateObject` and `@ObservableObject`
- Persistent storage using `UserDefaults` with version migration support

### Architecture
- **MVVM Pattern**: SwiftUI Views with ObservableObject ViewModels
- **Modular Structure**: Organized by features and core functionality
- **State Management**: Centralized onboarding store with persistence

- **Extras Options**: Voice journal, Jaw & neck release, Posture drill, Tongue posture, Caffeine cap, No smoke, No alcohol, Nasal breathing

## Technical Requirements

- **iOS 17.0+**: Minimum deployment target
- **Swift 5.0+**: Language version
- **SwiftUI**: Primary UI framework
- **Xcode 15.0+**: Development environment

## Bundle Information

- **Bundle ID**: `com.davidmoreno.deeper`
- **App Name**: Deeper
- **Version**: 1.0.0

## Development Status

This is the initial SwiftUI implementation with:
- âœ… Project structure and navigation
- âœ… Theme system and color assets
- âœ… Basic UI components
- âœ… Onboarding flow structure
- âœ… State management and persistence
- ðŸ”„ Individual screen implementations (placeholder views created)
- ðŸ”„ Feature-specific UI components
- ðŸ”„ Advanced animations and interactions

## Next Steps

1. Implement individual onboarding screen logic and UI
2. Add feature-specific components (Home, Paywall screens)
3. Integrate with backend APIs if needed
4. Add animations and micro-interactions
5. Implement accessibility features
6. Add unit and UI tests

## Notes

This iOS app serves as a native companion to the Expo app, allowing for platform-specific optimizations while maintaining feature parity. The modular architecture makes it easy to extend with additional features and maintain consistency across platforms.
